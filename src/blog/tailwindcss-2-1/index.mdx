The first new feature update since Tailwind CSS v2.0 is here and loaded with lots of cool stuff! We've merged the new JIT engine to core, added first-class support for composable CSS filters, added blending mode utilities, and a bunch more.

Here are some of the highlights:

- [JIT engine in core](#jit-engine-in-core)
- [Composable CSS filters API](#new-filter-and-backdrop-filter-utilities)
- [New blending mode utilities](#new-blending-mode-utilities)
- [New isolation utilities](#new-isolation-utilities)

## JIT engine in core

The <Link href="https://blog.tailwindcss.com/just-in-time-the-next-generation-of-tailwind-css">brand-new JIT engine we announced in March</Link> has now been merged into core, and is available as an opt-in feature using a new `mode` option in your `tailwind.config.js` file:

```js
module.exports = {
  mode: "jit",
  purge: [
    // ...
  ],
  // ...
};
```

**This feature is still in preview** which means some details may change as we iron out the kinks, and it's not subject to semantic versioning.

If you were using `@tailwindcss/jit` before, you can now migrate to Tailwind CSS v2.1 instead, as that's where all new development on the engine will happen.

Read the <Link href="https://v2.tailwindcss.com/docs/just-in-time-mode">Just-in-Time Mode documentation</Link> to learn more.

## Composable CSS filters API

This is a huge one — we've finally added first-class support for CSS filters!

They work a lot like our `transform` utilities, where you use `filter` to enable filters, and combine it with utilities like `grayscale`, `blur-lg`, or `saturate-200` to compose filters on the fly.

```html
<div class="blur-md grayscale invert filter ...">
  <!-- ... -->
</div>
```

...and here's what `backdrop-filter` looks like:

```html
<div class="backdrop-blur backdrop-brightness-50 backdrop-filter ...">
  <!-- ... -->
</div>
```

Check out the <Link href="https://v2.tailwindcss.com/docs/filter">filter</Link> and <Link href="https://v2.tailwindcss.com/docs/backdrop-filter">backdrop-filter</Link> to learn more. We'll add a bunch of helpful visual examples there soon!

## New blending mode utilities

We've added brand new utilities for `mix-blend-mode` and `background-blend-mode`:

```html
<div class="mix-blend-multiply ...">
  <!-- ... -->
</div>
```

Check out <Link href="https://v2.tailwindcss.com/docs/mix-blend-mode">the documentation</Link> to learn more.

## New isolation utilities

We've added new `isolate` and `isolation-auto` utilities for working with the `isolation` property:

```html
<div class="isolate ...">
  <!-- ... -->
</div>
```

This can be really helpful for scoping blending mode features or z-index adjustments and is super powerful.

Check out <Link href="https://v2.tailwindcss.com/docs/isolation">the documentation</Link> to learn more.

I also highly recommend <Link href="https://www.joshwcomeau.com/css/stacking-contexts/#airtight-abstractions-with-isolation">this great article by Josh Comeau</Link> to see it in action.

## Upgrading

Tailwind CSS v2.1 is an incremental upgrade with no breaking changes, so to upgrade you just need to run:

```bash
npm install tailwindcss@latest
```

If you were previously using `@tailwindcss/jit`, you can now switch back to `tailwindcss` and update your PostCSS configuration accordingly.

Ready to upgrade? <Link href="https://npmjs.com/tailwindcss">Get it from npm →</Link>

This migration ensures the content adheres to the new v4 format, utilizing the components and codes specified for examples, excerpts, and code blocks.
