### Left aligning text

Use the `text-left` utility to left align the text of an element:

<Figure>

<Example padding={false}>
  {
    <div className="px-4 sm:px-0">
      <div className="mx-auto max-w-lg p-8 text-sm/6 text-gray-900 dark:text-gray-200">
        <p className="text-left">
          So I started to walk into the water. I won't lie to you boys, I was terrified. But I pressed on, and as I made
          my way past the breakers a strange calm came over me. I don't know if it was divine intervention or the
          kinship of all living things but I tell you Jerry at that moment, I <em>was</em> a marine biologist.
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>
  }
</Example>

```html
<!-- [!code classes:text-left] -->
<p class="text-left">So I started to walk into the water...</p>
```

</Figure>

### Right aligning text

Use the `text-right` utility to right align the text of an element:

<Figure>

<Example padding={false}>
  {
    <div className="px-4 sm:px-0">
      <div className="mx-auto max-w-lg p-8 text-sm/6 text-gray-900 dark:text-gray-200">
        <p className="text-right">
          So I started to walk into the water. I won't lie to you boys, I was terrified. But I pressed on, and as I made
          my way past the breakers a strange calm came over me. I don't know if it was divine intervention or the
          kinship of all living things but I tell you Jerry at that moment, I <em>was</em> a marine biologist.

  }
</Example>

<!-- [!code classes:text-right] -->
<p class="text-right">So I started to walk into the water...</p>
```

</Figure>

### Centering text

Use the `text-center` utility to center the text of an element:

<Figure>

<Example padding={false}>
  {
    <div className="px-4 sm:px-0">
      <div className="mx-auto max-w-lg p-8 text-sm/6 text-gray-900 dark:text-gray-200">
        <p className="text-center">
          So I started to walk into the water. I won't lie to you boys, I was terrified. But I pressed on, and as I made
          my way past the breakers a strange calm came over me. I don't know if it was divine intervention or the
          kinship of all living things but I tell you Jerry at that moment, I <em>was</em> a marine biologist.
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>
  }
</Example>

```html
<!-- [!code classes:text-center] -->
<p class="text-center">So I started to walk into the water...</p>
```

</Figure>

### Justifying text

Use the `text-justify` utility to justify the text of an element:

<Figure>

<Example padding={false}>
  {
    <div className="px-4 sm:px-0">
      <div className="mx-auto max-w-lg p-8 text-sm/6 text-gray-900 dark:text-gray-200">
        <p className="text-justify">
          So I started to walk into the water. I won't lie to you boys, I was terrified. But I pressed on, and as I made
          my way past the breakers a strange calm came over me. I don't know if it was divine intervention or the
          kinship of all living things but I tell you Jerry at that moment, I <em>was</em> a marine biologist.
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>
  }
</Example>

```html

<p class="text-justify">So I started to walk into the water...</p>
```
